## Abstract

Background: Gene-environment interaction is likely to contribute to human development, but individual effects are difficult to detect, especially for behavioural outcomes. Genetic variants associated with phenotypic variability (i.e. those with heteroscedastic effects) are potential candidates for tests of interaction. We conduct the first study estimating genetic effects on phenotypic variability in childhood behavioural traits.

Methods: We used item response theory models to reduce measurement error in 71 behavioural traits across childhood (ages 6 months - 14 years) in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Birth Cohort Study (MoBa; N<sub>MEAN</sub>: 44,788; N<sub>MAX</sub>: 62,897) and subsequently tested for genome-wide association (GWA) of mean and variance effects. Downstream analyses included phenome-wide association analyses of independently associated loci, estimation of SNP-based heritability and genetic correlation, and polygenic score analysis in an independent sample, the Twins Early Development Study (N<sub>MAX</sub>=9,116). All analyses were repeated in height and weight outcomes, to compare with analyses of behaviour.

Results: Across the 71 behavioural phenotypes, there were 17 independent genetic variants associated with phenotypic variability, and 44 associated with mean levels. Genome-wide variance effects explained up to 9.7% of the variance (mean h2<sub>vGWA</sub>=1.8%), whereas mean effects explained up to 15.8% of the phenotypic variance (mean h2<sub>GWA</sub>=6.0%). In comparison, for height and weight variance effects explained up to 6.7% of the variance in phenotypic variability (mean h2<sub>vGWA</sub>=2.1%), and mean effects explained up to 42.7% of the phenotypic variance (mean h2<sub>GWA</sub>=30.5%). There was some evidence that higher variance-based polygenic scores were associated with greater phenotypic variance (p\<0.01), but associations were not consistent across traits, ages or statistical models.

Discussion: In keeping with previous analyses of genetic effects on trait variability, there were fewer variance effects than mean effects. This finding was mirrored across all levels of analysis. Detecting genetic effects sufficient for variance-based polygenic scores and tests of GÃ—E involved in childhood behaviour will require larger samples. Nonetheless, we performed some of the largest single cohort GWA of childhood behaviour, and detected interesting mean and variance effects for follow-up analyses. We have provided an extensive summary of the phenotypes assessed in MoBa accompanied by GWA summary statistics made available for future meta-analyses.
